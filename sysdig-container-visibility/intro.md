Sysdig is a simple tool for deep system visibility that comes with container native support.

Think of all the system health and performance monitoring tools you used for troubleshooting but now working all together and container aware:
- strace
- tcpdump
- htop
- iftop
- lsof
and way more... awesome sauce.

In this scenario, you will learn with some basic and cool examples how to add container visibility without modifying existing container-based deployments:

* Which containers and processes have higher CPU usage?

* What is the network network activity between containers and processes?

* Which containers and processes have bottlenecks on disk IO?
