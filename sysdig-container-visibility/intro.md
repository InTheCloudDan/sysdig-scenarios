Containers are becoming increasingly popular as building blocks for deploying applications. But there is a catch: monitoring and troubleshooting.  Many common Linux tools – the same visibility tools we’ve all been using for decades – are now failing to perform as expected. We’re suddenly flying blind.

In this scenario, you will learn how to add container visibility without modifying existing container-based deployments. This scenario will explain how to identify containers:

* Utilising High CPU load

* Utilising High Network Activity

* Utilising High Disk IO

* Logging Across Multiple Containers

* Network Traffic and Communication Between Multiple Containers
