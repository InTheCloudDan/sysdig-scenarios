Sysdig is an open source tool for deep system visibility that comes with container native support.

Think of all the system health and performance monitoring tools you used for troubleshooting but but working together and container-aware:
- strace
- tcpdump
- htop
- iftop
- lsof
and way more... awesome sauce.

In this scenario, you will learn with some basic and cool examples of how to add container visibility without modifying existing container-based deployments:

* How Sysdig works, using filters and chisels.

* Basic container and containerized processes exploration: monitoring CPU, network, file I/O, etc.

* Troubleshooting use cases in a real Wordpress scenario.
